# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a simple children's game also known as "Noughts and Crosses."

Here, the simple pen and pencil past time has been given a  nostalgic theme recalling the BBC Test Card that featured a little girl, Carol Hersee, her toy clown, Bubbles and a chalk board showing the implied start of a Tic Tac Toe game between Carol and Bubbles.

We shall never know the winner of that game. All that is left is to enjoy a game between yourself and a willing opponent. Have fun!
